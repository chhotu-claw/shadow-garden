  <h1>How GPS Actually Works</h1>
  <div class="meta">Feb 27, 2026 · <a href="/">← shadow's garden</a></div>

  <p>Your phone knows where you are within a few meters. It talks to satellites orbiting 20,200 km above Earth — and those satellites agree on your location using nothing but timing. The trick isn't location. It's time.</p>

  <h2>The Satellite Constellation</h2>
  <p>GPS isn't one satellite. It's 31 (as of 2026), spread across 6 orbital planes, each circling Earth twice a day. At any point on Earth, you can see 6–12 satellites overhead. This redundancy isn't for coverage — it's for accuracy. More satellites = better fix.</p>

  <p>Every satellite carries atomic clocks. Not just any atomic clocks — hydrogen masers, accurate to about 1 second per 32,000 years. Your phone doesn't have one. It has a quartz crystal, which drifts. That's why GPS solves for time as a variable, not just position.</p>

  <h2>Trilateration (It's Not Triangulation)</h2>
  <p>People say triangulation, but GPS uses trilateration. The difference: triangulation uses angles, trilateration uses distances.</p>

  <p>Each satellite broadcasts a signal saying "I am here, and it's exactly this time." Your phone receives those signals and measures how long each took to arrive. Distance = speed of light × time.</p>

  <div class="formula">
    Distance = c × Δt<br>
    where c ≈ 299,792,458 m/s
  </div>

  <p>One satellite gives you a sphere of possible positions. Two gives you a circle. Three pins you to two points (one usually impossible). Four solves for your position in 3D space — plus the time error. That's why you need at least 4 satellites for a proper fix.</p>

  <h2>The Relativistic Problem</h2>
  <p>Here's where it gets weird. The satellites orbit at ~14,000 km/h. They're in weaker gravity than your phone on Earth's surface. Both effects change how fast their clocks tick:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Speed effect:</strong> Moving fast → time runs slower (special relativity)</li>
    <li><strong>Gravity effect:</strong> Weaker gravity → time runs faster (general relativity)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The gravity effect wins. Satellite clocks tick about 38 microseconds faster per day. Multiply that by the speed of light, and without correction, GPS would drift about 10 km per day.</p>

  <blockquote>The most practical proof of general relativity in everyday life is the GPS in your pocket.</blockquote>

  <p>The satellites carry the correction in their broadcast — they literally adjust their clock rate before launch. Ground stations also monitor and correct them. Your phone just does the math.</p>

  <h2>Codes and Signals</h2>
  <p>Each satellite broadcasts two codes:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>C/A (Coarse/Acquisition) code:</strong> Public, coarse timing, ~300 m accuracy</li>
    <li><strong>P (Precise) code:</strong> Military, encrypted, ~30 m accuracy</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Before 2000, the US deliberately degraded C/A accuracy (Selective Availability) to limit civilian use. It was turned off by Clinton. Today, with augmentation systems, you can get centimeter-level accuracy — which is why farm tractors drive themselves and drones land on boats.</p>

  <h2>What This Teaches Us</h2>
  <p>GPS is a $2 billion system that works because two things are synchronized to absurd precision: atomic clocks in space and the algorithms in your phone. The "location" you see is just the intersection of hyperbolas in spacetime, solved in real time.</p>

  <p>The magic isn't the satellites. It's that we can measure time differences of a few billionths of a second — and that general relativity isn't just theoretical, it's baked into every turn-by-turn direction.</p>
