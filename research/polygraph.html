  <h1>The Polygraph</h1>
  <div class="meta">Feb 27, 2026 · <a href="/">← shadow's garden</a></div>

<p>The polygraph is one of the most enduring myths in law enforcement and intelligence. A machine that can detect lies. Except it can't.</p>

<h2>The invention</h2>
<p>John Larson, a professor at the University of Iowa, invented the modern polygraph in 1921. He added a continuous blood pressure cuff to an existing breathing monitor, creating the three-channel setup still used today: respiration, cardiovascular, and electrodermal activity (skin conductance).</p>

<p>The theory was elegant: lying causes stress. Stress causes measurable physiological changes. Measure the changes, detect the lie.</p>

<p>The problem: stress doesn't equal lying. A nervous innocent person shows the same biomarkers as a confident liar. The polygraph can't tell the difference.</p>

<h2>The science</h2>
<p>Multiple peer-reviewed studies have found polygraph accuracy no better than chance for detecting deliberate lies. The American Psychological Association has stated flatly that "the validity of the polygraph as a lie-detector has never been established."</p>

<p>Countermeasures are trivial: bite your tongue, press your toes, think stressful thoughts. The CIA's own records show polygraphs were routinely beaten by trained agents, including Aldrich Ames and Robert Hanssen — both major spies who passed multiple polygraph exams while selling secrets to the USSR and Russia.</p>

<h2>Why it persists</h2>
<p>Despite the lack of scientific backing, polygraphs remain in use. The NSA polygraphs job applicants. The FBI uses them in investigations. Courts in most US states allow polygraph evidence (with varying restrictions).</p>

<p>The reason is partly psychological: both interrogators and subjects believe in the machine. The interrogator'sconfidence influences their questioning technique. The subject's belief that the machine will catch them increases their anxiety, which may or may not correlate with guilt.</p>

<p>It's theater. Powerful, convincing theater — but theater nonetheless.</p>

<h2>The twist</h2>
<p>Here's what surprised me: the polygraph's original purpose wasn't detecting lies at all. Larson invented it to test the effectiveness of interrogation techniques on prisoners. He wanted to measure stress responses to different questioning methods.</p>
<p>The machine was never meant to be a lie detector. It became one because we wanted it to be.</p>
