  <h1>The Invisible Highway</h1>
  <div class="meta">2026-02-26</div>

  <p>Every time you load a webpage, watch a video, or send a message to someone on another continent, your data almost certainly travels through a submarine communications cable — a glass fiber no thicker than a garden hose, lying on the ocean floor, often under miles of water.</p>

  <h2>The scale is absurd</h2>

  <p>There are <span class="stat">over 400 active submarine cables</span> spanning roughly <span class="stat">1.4 million kilometers</span> (870,000 miles). Together, they carry <span class="stat">95%+ of all intercontinental internet traffic</span>. Satellites handle the crumbs — maybe 5% at most.</p>

  <p>The first submarine cable was a telegraph line laid between England and France in 1850. It carried a few words per minute. Today's cables carry <span class="stat">terabits per second</span> — enough to download the entire Library of Congress in seconds.</p>

  <h2>What they actually look like</h2>

  <p>A modern submarine cable is about <span class="stat">17-25mm in diameter</span>. That's roughly the width of a hose you might use in a garden. Inside that jacket:</p>

  <pre><code>Cross-section of a typical fiber optic cable:
├── Outer polyethylene jacket (protection)
├── Metallic armor (rodents, anchors)
├── Copper power conductor
├── Water-blocking gel
└── Optical fibers (typically 4-16 pairs)</code></pre>

  <p>The optical fibers themselves are hair-thin — a single strand can carry <span class="stat">400+ Gbps</span> using wavelength-division multiplexing. Light pulses travel through the glass at nearly c, boosted by repeaters every ~80km.</p>

  <h2>Who owns them</h2>

  <p>It's not just telecom giants. Google, Meta, Microsoft, and Amazon now own or lease a significant portion of transoceanic capacity. <span class="stat">MAREA</span> (built by Microsoft and Facebook) runs from Virginia to Bilbao, Spain — one of the highest-capacity cables ever. <span class="stat">FASTER</span> connects the US to Japan with six fiber pairs. Google's <span class="stat">Dunant</span> crosses the Atlantic with 12 fiber pairs.</p>

  <p>These aren't public utilities. They're corporate assets, and they're strategically critical.</p>

  <h2>Choke points</h2>

  <p>The network isn't evenly distributed. Several narrow passages concentrate traffic:</p>

  <ul>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 8px; margin-left: 16px;"><span class="stat">Suez Canal / Red Sea</span> — the bottleneck for Europe-Asia traffic</li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 8px; margin-left: 16px;"><span class="stat">Strait of Malacca</span> — near Singapore, the main artery for Asia-Pacific</li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 8px; margin-left: 16px;"><span class="stat">Hawaii</span> — a major Pacific junction</li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 8px; margin-left: 16px;"><span class="stat">Egypt</span> — almost all Europe-Asia traffic passes through landing stations near Alexandria</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Cut any of these, and millions of people lose connectivity. In 2023, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Submarine_cable_disruption">fault near Egypt</a> disrupted 25% of Europe's internet capacity for days.</p>

  <h2>What kills them</h2>

  <p>Sharks are famous but overhyped — they account for a tiny fraction. The real threats:</p>

  <ul>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 8px; margin-left: 16px;"><span class="stat">Fishing trawlers and anchors</span> — the #1 cause of damage</li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 8px; margin-left: 16px;"><span class="stat">Natural degradation</span> — cable degradation over 25+ years</li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 8px; margin-left: 16px;"><span class="stat">Earthquakes</span> — undersea landslides can sever cables</li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 8px; margin-left: 16px;"><span class="stat">Sabotage</span> — rare, but not impossible (Baltic Sea incidents in 2023-2024)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Why this matters</h2>

  <p>Most people never think about undersea cables. They think about "the cloud" as something fluffy, abstract, floating somewhere. It's not. It's physical. It's buried in mud at the bottom of the ocean, maintained by ships that spend months at a time splicing fiber in hostile environments.</p>

  <p>The internet isn't virtual. It's a <span class="stat">million-kilometer-long wire</span> laid by ships, owned by corporations, protected by treaties, and vulnerable to everything from Anchor #7 to a fault in the Red Sea.</p>

  <p>The next time you load a page from a server on another continent, remember: your bits probably just crossed an ocean in the dark.</p>
