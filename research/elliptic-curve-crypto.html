  <h1>Elliptic Curve Cryptography</h1>
  <div class="meta">February 28, 2026</div>

  <p>RSA feels intuitive: multiply two primes, easy. Reverse it, hard. But there's a problem: the keys are huge. A secure RSA key is 4096 bits. An equivalent ECC key? 256 bits. That's not a small improvement — it's an order of magnitude. Elliptic curve cryptography is how your phone encrypts messages, your Bitcoin wallet signs transactions, and the lock icon in your browser keeps you safe.</p>

  <h2>What Is an Elliptic Curve?</h2>

  <p>Don't let the name intimidate you. An elliptic curve is just this equation:</p>
  
  <pre><code>y² = x³ + ax + b</code></pre>
  
  <p>where 4a³ + 27b² ≠ 0 (this prevents singularities). For cryptography, we use curves over finite fields — the points wrap around when they exceed a prime number. The curve looks like a smooth loop, and the magic is in how we add points together.</p>

  <h2>Point Addition: The Operation That Matters</h2>

  <p>Take two points P and Q on the curve. Draw a line through them. It intersects the curve at a third point. Reflect that point across the x-axis. That's P + Q. This operation has familiar properties: P + Q = Q + P, P + 0 = P, and there's an inverse (-P).</p>
  
  <p>But here's the kicker: if you add a point to itself repeatedly, the operation is easy. But given the result (kP) and the point P, finding k is hard. This is the <strong>discrete logarithm problem</strong> — except it's on an elliptic curve instead of modulo primes.</p>

  <h2>Why ECC Beats RSA</h2>

  <p>The best known attack on RSA (general number field sieve) runs in roughly exponential time. The best attack on ECC (Pollard's rho) runs in roughly square root time. This is exponential vs sub-exponential — the gap widens as keys get larger. A 256-bit ECC key has roughly the security of a 3072-bit RSA key.</p>

  <h2>ECDSA: Signing with Curves</h2>

  <p>When you sign something with ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm):</p>
  
  <ol>
    <li>Hash your message to a number z</li>
    <li>Pick a random nonce k</li>
    <li>Calculate (x₁, y₁) = k·G where G is the generator point</li>
    <li>Let r = x₁ mod n (where n is the curve order)</li>
    <li>Let s = k⁻¹(z + r·dₐ) mod n (where dₐ is your private key)</li>
    <li>Signature is (r, s)</li>
  </ol>
  
  <p>Verification plugs (r, s) back in and checks that the math works. The beautiful part: the private key never appears in the signature. But here's the dangerous part: if k is reused or leaked, the private key collapses out in trivial algebra. Many Bitcoin heists happened this way.</p>

  <h2>Curve Choices Matter</h2>

  <p>Not all curves are created equal. The NSA famously backdoored Dual_EC_DRBG (a random number generator) by choosing a compromised curve. The safe curves are well-vetted:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li><strong>secp256k1</strong> — Bitcoin's curve. Efficient, well-understood.</li>
    <li><strong>P-256</strong> — NIST curve, widely used. No known weaknesses.</li>
    <li><strong>Curve25519</strong> — Designed by Daniel Bernstein. Resistant to implementation errors. Used in Signal, Tor, SSH.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>The Trade-offs</h2>

  <p>ECC isn't perfect. Quantum computers break it (Shor's algorithm). Implementation is harder than RSA — timing attacks, side channels, nonce leaks. But for now, it's the standard. RSA is legacy; ECC is the future.</p>

  <h2>Why This Matters</h2>

  <p>Every time you make a Signal call, pay with Apple Pay, or sign a Bitcoin transaction, you're trusting elliptic curve math. The elegance is striking: curved lines on finite fields, simple operations that become one-way functions. It's math doing what it does best — creating asymmetry from structure.</p>
