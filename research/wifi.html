  <h1>How WiFi Works</h1>
  <div class="meta">March 1, 2026</div>

  <p>You open your laptop. You connect to a network named "CoffeeShop". Seconds later, you're streaming music. This seems like magic. It's not — it's decades of engineering compressed into a protocol stack that your computer handles without asking.</p>

  <h2>Radio, Not Magic</h2>

  <p>WiFi is just radio. The same physics your grandfather used to listen to AM broadcasts is what your phone uses to fetch emails. The difference is in the details: frequency, modulation, and encoding.</p>

  <p>WiFi operates on two main frequency bands: <strong>2.4 GHz</strong> and <strong>5 GHz</strong>. The 2.4 GHz band is the old neighborhood — longer range, more congestion, slower speeds. The 5 GHz band is the express lane — shorter range, less interference, faster data. Newer routers add <strong>6 GHz</strong> (WiFi 6E) for even more breathing room.</p>

  <p>These aren't arbitrary numbers. They fall in the <strong>unlicensed spectrum</strong> — frequencies the government decided anyone could use without a license. The tradeoff: you share these frequencies with everyone else. Your neighbor's router, your microwave, your Bluetooth headphones. Congestion is the price of freedom.</p>

  <h2>Modulation: Packing Bits into Waves</h2>

  <p>Radio waves are just electromagnetic oscillations. To send data, you modulate some property of the wave: amplitude (strength), frequency (speed), or phase (timing). WiFi uses complex combinations of these, especially <strong>phase-shift keying (PSK)</strong> and <strong>quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM)</strong>.</p>

  <p>Think of it like Morse code, but instead of dots and dashes, you have thousands of possible symbols per second. WiFi 6 uses 1024-QAM, meaning each symbol can represent 10 bits. That's how we squeeze gigabits out of thin air.</p>

  <h2>CSMA/CA: The Protocol of Sharing</h2>

  <p>Here's the problem: everyone shares the same air. How do you avoid collisions?</p>

  <p>WiFi's solution is <strong>Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance</strong> (CSMA/CA). Before transmitting, your device listens. If it hears anything else, it waits. If the channel is clear, it sends — but includes a tiny wait window just in case. This "listen before talk" approach keeps the peace, but it also limits speed. The more devices on a network, the more everyone waits.</p>

  <p>This is why crowded coffee shops feel slow. Not because the router is weak — because everyone's taking turns.</p>

  <h2>802.11: The Alphabet Soup</h2>

  <p>WiFi standards are named 802.11 followed by a letter: <strong>b, a, g, n, ac, ax</strong>. Each iteration brings speed improvements:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>802.11b</strong> (1999): Up to 11 Mbps, 2.4 GHz — the original mainstream WiFi</li>
    <li><strong>802.11a</strong> (1999): Up to 54 Mbps, 5 GHz — faster but shorter range, less popular</li>
    <li><strong>802.11g</strong> (2003): Up to 54 Mbps, 2.4 GHz — best of both worlds</li>
    <li><strong>802.11n</strong> (2009): Up to 600 Mbps, both bands — MIMO enters the picture</li>
    <li><strong>802.11ac</strong> (2013): Up to 3.5 Gbps, 5 GHz — wave beams, wider channels</li>
    <li><strong>802.11ax</strong> (2019): Up to 9.6 Gbps, 2.4/5/6 GHz — OFDMA, target wake time</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>MIMO</strong> (Multiple Input, Multiple Output) was the big leap. Instead of one antenna talking to one antenna, you use multiple antennas on both ends to send parallel streams. Your router has four antennas? You can talk to four devices simultaneously. <strong>MU-MIMO</strong> extends this to multiple devices at once.</p>

  <h2>OFDMA: The Efficiency Boost</h2>

  <p>WiFi 6 introduced <strong>Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiple Access</strong> (OFDMA). Previously, each transmission took the whole channel. Now, a single channel splits into smaller "resource units." Your phone gets a slice, your laptop gets a slice, your smart fridge gets a slice — all at the same time.</p>

  <p>This is why WiFi 6 feels faster in crowded places. It's not just raw speed — it's efficiency.</p>

  <h2>Security: WPA3</h2>

  <p>WiFi security has evolved: <strong>WEP</strong> (broken), <strong>WPA</strong> (patched), <strong>WPA2</strong> (standard), <strong>WPA3</strong> (current). The biggest improvement in WPA3 is <strong>Simultaneous Authentication of Equals</strong> (SAE), which replaces the vulnerable handshake with a password-authenticated key exchange. Even if someone captures the handshake, they can't easily crack the password.</p>

  <h2>The Takeaway</h2>

  <p>WiFi is a negotiation between physics (radio waves, spectrum), engineering (modulation, protocols), and economics (unlicensed spectrum, shared air). Every generation solves the same problem: how do we squeeze more data through the air without everyone crashing into each other?</p>

  <p>The answer keeps changing. But the basics — radio waves, modulation, shared channels — haven't. Your coffee shop connection is built on the same principles as the first wireless telegraphs.</p>
