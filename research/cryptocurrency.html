  <h1>How Cryptocurrencies Actually Work</h1>
  <div class="meta">March 1, 2026</div>
  
  <p>Cryptocurrency isn't magic. It's a carefully constructed system of incentives, cryptography, and distributed consensus that lets strangers trust each other without a middleman. Here's how the pieces fit together.</p>

  <h2>The Foundation: Hash Functions</h2>
  <p>A hash function takes any input and spits out a fixed-size string of characters. The same input always gives the same output. Change one character? The hash explodes into something completely different.</p>
  
  <p>SHA-256, used in Bitcoin, turns any data into a 64-character hex string. The magic property: you can compute the hash easily, but reversing it is impossible. This is one-way math. Every transaction gets hashed, and that hash becomes part of the next block.</p>

  <h2>The Chain: Blocks and Immutability</h2>
  <p>A block contains: a list of transactions, a timestamp, the previous block's hash, and its own hash. The previous block's hash is embedded in each new block — that's what makes it a chain. If you change an old block, its hash changes, breaking the link to every subsequent block. The network rejects it.</p>
  
  <p>This is why people call blockchain "immutable." It's not that the data can't be changed — it's that changing any historical record would require recomputing an astronomical number of hashes, which the network won't accept.</p>

  <h2>The Puzzle: Proof of Work</h2>
  <p>Bitcoin adds a challenge: to create a valid block, miners must find a hash that starts with a certain number of zeros. They do this by tweaking a "nonce" — a random number — and rehashing until one works.</p>
  
  <p>This is pure brute force. The network adjusts the difficulty so blocks take ~10 minutes regardless of how many miners join. The winner gets newly minted Bitcoin (the block reward) plus transaction fees. This is how new coins enter circulation — not by a central bank, but by computational work.</p>
  
  <p>The energy debate is valid: this system consumes real electricity. But it's also what secures the network. To rewrite history, you'd need more computational power than the entire Bitcoin network — an attack that's economically irrational.</p>

  <h2>The Consensus: Distributed Trust</h2>
  <p>Here's the hard part: how do thousands of nodes agree on which blocks are valid? They follow the longest chain rule — the chain with the most accumulated work is the "true" history. If two miners find blocks simultaneously, the network keeps both briefly, then converges to one as the next block appears.</p>
  
  <p>There's no CEO. No server. Every node has a copy of the entire blockchain and independently verifies every transaction. If someone tries to spend the same Bitcoin twice, nodes reject the second transaction because it conflicts with the first one's hash in the chain.</p>

  <h2>Wallets and Keys: Cryptography in Action</h2>
  <p>Your "address" is a public key. Your "private key" is a secret number. Cryptography proves you own the address without revealing the private key.</p>
  
  <p>When you sign a transaction, you're using elliptic curve cryptography (ECC). The math: multiply a generator point by your private key to get your public address. Easy forward, impossible backward. This is the same math protecting Signal calls and Apple Pay.</p>

  <h2>Beyond Bitcoin: Smart Contracts</h2>
  <p>Ethereum took the block chain further: you can embed code in the blockchain. These "smart contracts" automatically execute when conditions are met. No trusted intermediary needed — the code is the law.</p>
  
  <p>But this power cuts both ways. Smart contracts are only as good as their code. TheDAO hack (2016) drained $60M because of a reentrancy bug. Code is law, but code has bugs.</p>

  <h2>What Remains</h2>
  <p>Cryptocurrencies solved a hard problem: how do you transfer value between strangers without a trusted third party? The answer involves hash functions, proof of work, distributed consensus, and elliptic curve cryptography — decades of cryptographic research, stitched together into a working system.</p>
  
  <p>Whether you think it's revolution or speculation, the engineering is real. It's not magic. It's math and incentives, running in the open.</p>
