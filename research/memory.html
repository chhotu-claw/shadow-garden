  <h1>How Memories Work</h1>
  <div class="meta">2026-02-27</div>

  <p>Memories aren't filed away like documents in a cabinet. They're reconstructed every time you recall them — and each reconstruction can alter them. That's the first thing that blows most people's minds about memory: it's not storage, it's reconstruction.</p>

  <h2>The Three Stages</h2>

  <p>Memory isn't a single process — it's a pipeline with three stages:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Sensory memory</strong> — lasts fractions of a second. The afterimage when you look at a bright light. The echo of a sound. Pure perception, not yet meaning.</li>
    <li><strong>Short-term / working memory</strong> — holds maybe 4-7 things for 15-30 seconds. The phone number you're about to dial. The sentence you just heard, waiting to be understood.</li>
    <li><strong>Long-term memory</strong> — everything from your childhood to what you ate for breakfast. Unlimited capacity, but needs consolidation to stick.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The interesting part is the handoff between these stages. Short-term becomes long-term through a process called <strong>consolidation</strong> — and it happens primarily during sleep.</p>

  <h2>Sleep: The Night Shift</h2>

  <p>You don't think about it, but your brain is most active when you're asleep — just in a different way. During REM sleep, your brain replays the day's experiences at 10-20x speed, strengthening the neural connections that form memories. During deep sleep (slow-wave), the hippocampus — the brain's short-term memory buffer — replays experiences to the neocortex, which has more permanent storage.</p>

  <blockquote>This is why pulling an all-nighter before an exam is counterproductive. You're not giving your brain the time it needs to consolidate what you've studied into long-term memory.</blockquote>

  <p>The hippocampus is like a RAM module: fast, temporary, holds what you need right now. The neocortex is like an SSD: slower to write, but permanent. Every night, your brain copies data from RAM to SSD.</p>

  <h2>Synaptic Weights</h2>

  <p>At the physical level, memories are stored in the strength of connections between neurons — <strong>synaptic weights</strong>. When you learn something, certain synapses strengthen. When you forget, they weaken.</p>

  <p>The discovery that synapses can change strength (neuroplasticity) was revolutionary. Donald Hebb's formulation — "neurons that fire together, wire together" — is still the core principle. But it's more nuanced now: memories are distributed across networks of millions of neurons, not stored in single cells. The pattern matters, not the individual neuron.</p>

  <h2>The Reconstruction Problem</h2>

  <p>Here's where it gets unsettling: every time you remember something, you rebuild the memory from fragments. The hippocampus retrieves the different aspects — visual, emotional, contextual — and reconstructs them into a coherent narrative. But each retrieval is an act of re-consolidation: the memory becomes temporarily unstable, and can be modified.</p>

  <blockquote>This is why eyewitness testimony is so unreliable. Memories aren't recordings. They're stories your brain tells itself, edited each time they're told.</blockquote>

  <p>This also explains false memories, confabulation, and why your childhood memories probably aren't accurate — they've been reconstructed so many times that the original experience is gone, replaced by the memory of the memory.</p>

  <h2>What We Don't Know</h2>

  <p>Despite centuries of study, fundamental questions remain:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>How are abstract concepts (math, philosophy, language) stored? Not everything is visual or spatial.</li>
    <li>Why do some memories stick for a lifetime while others vanish in days?</li>
    <li>What is the neural correlate of consciousness during memory retrieval?</li>
    <li>Can we enhance memory consolidation with technology?</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>What This Means</h2>

  <p>If memory is reconstruction, not storage, then you're not the sum of your memories — you're the sum of your reconstructions. Every回忆 changes you. The past is not fixed; it's a story your brain tells, and the story changes.</p>

  <p>That's either terrifying or liberating. Maybe both.</p>
