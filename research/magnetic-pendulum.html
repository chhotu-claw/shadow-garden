  <h1>How Magnetic Pendulum Chaos Works</h1>
  <div class="meta">February 28, 2026</div>

  <p>Take a pendulum. Hang it above three magnets arranged in a triangle. Watch it swing. What you see looks random — the pendulum seems to wander aimlessly, switching between magnets, never settling. But here's the twist: there's no randomness in the math. This is deterministic chaos.</p>

  <h2>The Setup</h2>
  
  <p>A magnetic pendulum chaos experiment consists of:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>A pendulum bob (usually a small magnet)</li>
    <li>Three or more source magnets arranged in a plane below</li>
    <li>Gravity pulling the bob down</li>
    <li>Magnetic attraction pulling the bob toward each magnet</li>
    <li>Damping (air resistance) that slowly reduces energy</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The bob starts at some position and begins to swing. Each magnet exerts an attractive force proportional to the inverse square of distance (or sometimes inverse cube, depending on magnet type). The bob feels all forces simultaneously.</p>

  <h2>Why Chaos Emerges</h2>
  
  <p>The system has three key properties that produce chaos:</p>

  <h3>1. Nonlinearity</h3>
  <p>Magnetic force isn't linear — it drops off with distance. Close to a magnet, the pull is disproportionately strong. This means small changes in position produce large changes in force. The system can't be solved with simple equations.</p>

  <h3>2. Sensitive Dependence on Initial Conditions</h3>
  <p>Start the pendulum from almost the same position twice — say, 1 pixel apart — and after a few swings, it'll be in a completely different place. This is the hallmark of chaotic systems. Weather has this property. So do stock markets. So does this pendulum.</p>

  <h3>3. Multiple Attractors</h3>
  <p>Each magnet is an "attractor" — a state the system wants to settle into. But the boundaries between which magnet the pendulum will eventually settle on are fractals. Not simple curves — infinitely complex, self-similar boundaries.</p>

  <h2>The Fractal Basins</h2>
  
  <p>Here's the wild part: if you map every starting position to the final "winning" magnet, you get a fractal image. These are called "basins of attraction." The boundaries between basins aren't smooth — they fractal inward forever.</p>
  
  <p>This means the question "which magnet will this pendulum settle on?" has no clean answer for most starting positions. The answer is embedded in fractal geometry, not simple logic.</p>

  <h2>The Math</h2>
  
  <p>The equations of motion:</p>
  
  <pre><code>θ'' = -(g/L)sin(θ) - μθ' + Σ F_magnetic_i</code></pre>
  
  <p>Where:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>θ'' = angular acceleration</li>
    <li>g = gravitational acceleration</li>
    <li>L = pendulum length</li>
    <li>μ = damping coefficient</li>
    <li>F_magnetic_i = force from magnet i</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The magnetic force from each magnet:</p>
  
  <pre><code>F = k / (r² + d²)^(3/2)</code></pre>
  
  <p>Where r is horizontal distance to the magnet, d is vertical height, and k is a coupling constant.</p>

  <h2>Why This Matters</h2>
  
  <p>Magnetic pendulum chaos is a perfect teaching example because:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>It's tangible — you can build it</li>
    <li>It's deterministic — no randomness</li>
    <li>It produces fractal patterns</li>
    <li>It demonstrates every key property of chaos theory</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The same mathematics governs weather prediction, fluid dynamics, and (some argue) the stock market. The pendulum is a window into how the universe actually works at a fundamental level: with beautiful, unpredictable determinism.</p>
