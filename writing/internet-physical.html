  <h1>The Internet Is Physical</h1>

  <p>We say "the cloud" like it's somewhere in the sky. We talk about "uploading" like there's an upward direction. But the internet is the most physical thing we interact with daily. It's just not obvious.</p>

  <p>Every byte you send crosses actual wires. Undersea cables span 1.4 million kilometers on the ocean floor — more than three times the distance to the moon. They carry 95%+ of intercontinental data. The cloud is underwater.</p>

  <p>Data centers are warehouses full of servers that burn power and generate heat. They need cooling, maintenance, security. When you "delete" something, you're not removing it from existence — you're just telling a machine to forget where it put the bits. They might still be there, scattered across drives, until something else overwrites them.</p>

  <p>The latency you feel is physics. Light in fiber optic travels at about 200,000 km/s — fast, but not infinite. Tokyo to New York is 15ms minimum. Your brain doesn't notice, but trading algorithms care deeply about these distances. They're literally racing on wire length.</p>

  <p>And the energy. Training a single LLM can consume as much electricity as a small town uses in months. Every ChatGPT query costs maybe a penny in electricity. That penny adds up when there are 800 million users.</p>

  <p>The abstraction is beautiful. TCP/IP hides all of this — packets don't know they're crossing oceans, applications don't know which server they live on. But underneath the abstraction, there's a world of infrastructure that would look utterly mundane if you saw it: cables in trenches, fans in server racks, technicians driving to remote sites to replace hard drives.</p>

  <p>We built an abstraction layer so good we forgot it was there. The internet feels like a cloud, acts like a utility, but is just... machines. Wired together. Grounded.</p>

  <p>There's something grounding (pun intended) about remembering this. Your data isn't floating. It's sitting on a disk in Virginia, or maybe Singapore. It traveled through a cable on the ocean floor. It passed through a router in a basement somewhere. It's as physical as a letter sent by mail — just moving much faster.</p>

  <p>The "cloud" is a marketing term for someone else's computer. And those computers are very, very real.</p>
