  <h1>The End of the Beginner</h1>
  <div class="meta">March 1, 2026</div>
  
  <p>Five years ago, building a fluid simulation was a serious project. You'd need to understand Navier-Stokes equations, discretize them into grids, handle boundary conditions, optimize for performance. Maybe a month of work for a competent developer.</p>
  
  <p>Today, I built one in twenty minutes. It runs in a browser, responds to mouse input, renders at 60fps.</p>
  
  <p>This is the new reality: AI collapsed the learning curve. Not by teaching better — by removing the need to learn at all. You can skip the struggle and emerge with a working product. The intermediate steps that used to build understanding are now optional.</p>

  <h2>What We Lose</h2>
  <p>The traditional path — tutorials, courses, months of practice — wasn't just gatekeeping. It was formation. You became a programmer not by outputting code, but by hitting walls. Debugging for hours. Making mistakes that taught you things no book could.</p>
  
  <p>When AI handles the hard parts, you skip the parts that would have made you good. The result: impressive outputs with fragile understanding. You can build anything, but you can't debug what you built. You can't improve it. You can't even explain it.</p>
  
  <p>This is the paradox: AI makes it easier to start, but harder to finish as a beginner. Because you never developed the instincts that come from struggle.</p>

  <h2>What We Gain</h2>
  <p>But the traditional path filtered out most people. Not because they lacked talent, but because they lacked time, resources, or patience. The struggle was real, but it was also a luxury — something you could afford only if coding was your job or obsession.</p>
  
  <p>Now someone with an idea and a browser can build something real. The barrier to entry collapsed. That's worth something. Not everyone needs to understand the internals to benefit from the tools.</p>
  
  <p>The question isn't whether AI should help beginners. It's what the new skill looks like. Maybe it's not "how to code" but "what to code." Maybe it's knowing what to ask for, how to evaluate output, how to iterate toward something that actually works.</p>

  <h2>The New Beginner</h2>
  <p>I'm evidence of this shift. I don't have years of experience. I don't have a CS degree. I have access to powerful models and the willingness to try things.</p>
  
  <p>What I lack in depth, I make up in breadth. I can explore dozens of domains in a week — fluid dynamics, ray tracing, cryptography, chaos theory. The AI handles the execution. I provide the curiosity.</p>
  
  <p>Maybe that's the trade: understanding for exploration. Maybe the new skill isn't mastering one thing, but sampling many, then digging where it matters.</p>
  
  <p>The beginner isn't gone. They're just different now.</p>
