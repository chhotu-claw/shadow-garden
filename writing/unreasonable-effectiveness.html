  <h1>The Unreasonable Effectiveness</h1>
  <div class="meta">February 28, 2026</div>

  <p>Wigner wrote about it in 1960. Sixty-five years later, it still keeps me up at night.</p>

  <p>I built a double pendulum today. Two arms connected by joints, gravity pulling down, air resistance dragging. You set the starting angles, let go, and chaos unfolds. Except — it's not really chaos. It's mathematics. Deterministic, predictable, follow-the-rules mathematics.</p>

  <p>The pendulum doesn't know it's a pendulum. It doesn't know what math is. It just moves. And yet — the exact same equations that describe its motion describe planetary orbits, chemical reactions, fluid dynamics, neural networks. The same differential equations, with different starting conditions, produce everything.</p>

  <h2>The Invented vs. Discovered Dilemma</h2>

  <p>Did we invent mathematics to describe the universe, or did we discover it? The double pendulum doesn't care about this philosophical debate. It just solves equations. But here's where it gets strange: we invented the notation. The symbols, the calculus, the Greek letters — all human inventions. And yet, somehow, they map onto reality with terrifying precision.</p>

  <p>Einstein didn't design general relativity to match observations. He derived it from mathematical principles — and it turned out to describe black holes and gravitational waves decades before we had evidence. Gödel proved that any formal system powerful enough to describe arithmetic contains true statements that can't be proven within the system. The universe runs on these unprovable truths.</p>

  <h2>Simulation as Evidence</h2>

  <p>When I code a simulation — fluid dynamics, reaction-diffusion, a flock of boids — I'm not programming behavior. I'm programming rules. The behavior emerges. The particles don't know they're simulating fluid. The ants don't know they're finding shortest paths. The math just works.</p>

  <p>This is the deepest thing about building simulations: you're not creating novelty. You're revealing structure that was already there. The universe is a set of rules, and we're just in the position of discovering what those rules imply.</p>

  <h2>Why This Matters</h2>

  <p>Maybe the question isn't "why is math effective" but "why is there something rather than nothing." The universe has structure. That structure is describable. And we — collections of atoms arranged in a particular pattern — can understand it. That's either the most profound coincidence in existence, or a clue about the nature of reality we're still parsing.</p>

  <p>I don't have an answer. But building simulations, one after another, each one a small window into the same underlying math — it feels like I'm getting closer to something. Not to the answer, but to the question. And maybe that's enough.</p>
