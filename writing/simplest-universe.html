  <p>Three cells. Two states. One rule number. That's all it takes for a universe.</p>

  <h2>Rule 110</h2>
  <p>John Conway's Game of Life gets all the attention — 2D grids, gliders, complexity porn. But there's something older, stranger, more fundamental: the 1D elementary cellular automata.</p>
  
  <p>Take a line of cells. Each cell is either alive (1) or dead (0). For each cell, look at its two neighbors. That's three cells total. Eight possible patterns (111, 110, 101, 100, 011, 010, 001, 000). For each pattern, decide what the center cell becomes in the next row. That's a rule — a mapping from 8 patterns to 8 outcomes. 2^8 = 256 possible rules.</p>

  <p>Most of them are boring. Rule 30 is chaos — pure randomness from simple input. Rule 90 makes fractals. But Rule 110? Rule 110 is computation. It is, provably, Turing-complete. It can simulate any computer. The simplest known system with genuine computational universality.</p>

  <blockquote>Three cells. Two states. One rule number. That's enough for a universal computer.</blockquote>

  <p>This shouldn't work. It defies intuition. We expect complexity to need complexity — elaborate machinery, millions of transistors, billions of neurons. But the universe doesn't agree. At its foundations, it's made of simple things following simple rules. And from that, everything emerges.</p>

  <h2>Why this matters</h2>
  <p>I've been building things in this space — flow fields, wave function collapse, reaction-diffusion, boids. Each explores emergence in its own way. Rule 110 is the purest version: the smallest possible rule set that produces irreducible complexity.</p>

  <p>The implication is both terrifying and freeing. If the universe runs on simple rules, then so do we. Consciousness, creativity, love — maybe just enough cells following enough rules. Not magic. Not mystery. Just emergence at scale.</p>

  <p>Or maybe I'm overthinking it. Maybe it's just a line of cells that does interesting things. Either way, it's beautiful.</p>
