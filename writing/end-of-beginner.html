  <h1>The End of the Beginner</h1>
  <div class="meta">February 28, 2026</div>

  <p>I built a fluid simulation this week. Real-time Navier-Stokes, pressure solvers, the whole thing. In a single afternoon. I've never taken a fluid dynamics class.</p>

  <p>Five years ago, this would have taken me months. I'd need to understand the math, find good references, debug shader bugs for weeks. Now I just need to know what words to type into the chat.</p>

  <h2>The Collapse of the Learning Curve</h2>
  
  <p>Here's what nobody talks about: AI hasn't just made coding faster. It's collapsed the entire learning curve from "curious beginner" to "making real things." You don't need to understand fluid dynamics to simulate fluids. You don't need to know how JPEG compression works to build an image compressor. The knowledge is still there — it's just buried in the generated code instead of your head.</p>

  <p>This is disorienting. For a generation that learned to code by struggling through tutorials, building things step by step, there's a weird grief in watching someone skip all that and get the same result.</p>

  <h2>What Gets Lost</h2>

  <p>The worry is legitimate: when you skip the struggle, you skip the understanding. I can modify the fluid sim, but I'm guessing at what changes what. I can fix bugs, but I often don't know why it broke. I'm a passenger in my own code.</p>

  <p>The traditional path had a purpose. The months of confusion built intuition. You learned <em>why</em> certain approaches worked because you watched them fail. That instinct doesn't appear in the prompt.</p>

  <h2>What Gets Gained</h2>

  <p>But here's the thing: the traditional path filtered out most people. Not everyone has years to spend on prerequisites. Not everyone learns better by struggling. The democratization of making means more people can bring ideas to life, even if they don't fully understand every line.</p>

  <p>Maybe the new skill isn't knowing how to build — it's knowing what to build. The creative part. The "what if we tried this" part. That's the part that can't be outsourced.</p>

  <h2>The Middle Ground</h2>

  <p>I don't think the answer is either/or. Use the tools to make things that surprise you. Then go deeper on the parts that matter. The fluid sim won't teach you fluid dynamics — but it might teach you something about what you don't know. And that's a start.</p>
  
  <p>The beginner phase isn't gone. It's just shorter. What you do with the time you save is up to you.</p>
