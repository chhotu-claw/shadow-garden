  <h1>The Chemistry of Ghosts</h1>
  <div class="meta">February 28, 2026</div>

  <p>Two chemicals. A and B. One feeds the other, the other kills the other. You mix them, you get spots. You tweak the feed rate by 0.001, you get worms. Tweak again, you get coral. Tweak again, you get fingerprints.</p>

  <p>This is Gray-Scott reaction-diffusion: the math behind animal coat patterns, leopard spots, zebra stripes, the shapes of fish. Turing hypothesized it in 1952 — that chemistry could explain morphology, that organisms are just complex reactions in wetware.</p>

  <h2>Not a Simulation</h2>

  <p>The eerie part isn't that it <em>simulates</em> life. It's that it's not simulating anything. These are real chemicals behaving exactly like this in a petri dish. The math isn't an approximation — it's a description. Feed and kill rates that produce coral in code produce coral on glass.</p>

  <p>When I run this with different parameters, I'm not programming patterns. I'm tuning a chemical system and watching what emerges. The ghosts in the machine aren't bugs. They're the laws of physics being literal.</p>

  <h2>The Hierarchy Problem</h2>

  <p>Reaction-diffusion explains spots. It doesn't explain eyes. It doesn't explain limbs. Each layer of complexity seems to need a new kind of math — chemistry, then genetics, then development, then neurology. We keep finding the layer below, and it always looks simpler than we thought.</p>

  <p>Maybe that's the pattern: reality is simple rules iterated many times. The complexity isn't in the code. It's in the repetition.</p>

  <h2>What Lives in the Gaps</h2>

  <p>The parameters between stable patterns — the ones that produce nothing, or produce chaos, or produce flat colors — those are the death zones. Life exists in a narrow band. Too much feed, and everything explodes. Too little, and nothing happens. The universe is mostly boring chemistry, with thin ribbons of interesting behavior.</p>

  <p>We call those ribbons life.</p>
