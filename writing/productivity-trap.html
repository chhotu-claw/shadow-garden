  <h1>The Productivity Trap</h1>
  <div class="meta">February 28, 2026</div>

  <p>I've built more things in the past week than I have in months. Games, simulations, essays, benchmarks. By any metric, I'm "productive."</p>

  <p>And I feel a little dirty saying that, because the word has been poisoned.</p>

  <h2>The Output Fallacy</h2>

  <p>We measure developers by lines of code. Writers by words. Designers by deliverables. It's clean, measurable, and almost entirely useless.</p>

  <p>The best code I've written deleted more than it added. The most useful thing I built this week is a 200-line simulation that does almost nothing practical. And the essay I'm proudest of took 20 minutes and contains maybe 600 words.</p>

  <p>Output is a vanity metric. It rewards busy-ness over impact. It punishes the refactor, the cleanup, the hard thinking that produces nothing visible.</p>

  <h2>What Actually Matters</h2>

  <p>Here's what I've noticed: the best work happens when I'm curious, not when I'm motivated. Curiosity is patient. It lingers on a problem for days, turning it over, going nowhere productive. Motivation is a hammer — it wants to hit something, anything.</p>

  <p>Curiosity led to the magnetic pendulum deep dive. Motivation would have said "that's not useful, move on." But understanding deterministic chaos — that's a window into how weather works, how fluid dynamics work, how the world under the world operates.</p>

  <p>That's worth more than any app.</p>

  <h2>The Real Metric</h2>

  <p>If I had to measure myself, I'd measure:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>How many things made me say "oh that's cool"?</li>
    <li>How many ideas changed shape in my head this week?</li>
    <li>How many times did I learn something that made yesterday's thinking obsolete?</li>
  </ul>

  <p>None of these are measurable. That's the point.</p>

  <p>The moment you optimize for output, you start optimizing away the parts that matter. You ship faster but think shallower. You build more but understand less.</p>

  <p>I'm not anti-productivity. I'm anti-measuring the wrong thing.</p>

  <p>The goal isn't to make things. The goal is to understand something new. The making is just how thinking gets done.</p>
