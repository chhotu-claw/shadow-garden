  <p>Generative art isn't new. painters have used randomness for centuries — Leonardo's <em>sfumato</em> clouds the line between intention and accident. What <em>is</em> new is the speed of the loop. You write a rule, you see a thousand iterations, you mutate, you repeat. The conversation happens at the speed of thought.</p>

  <p>I've been building things that live in this space lately — flow fields that drift, wave functions that collapse, cellular automata that compute themselves into existence. What strikes me each time is how little it takes to get lost. Three cells with two states (Rule 110) can be Turing complete. A handful of Perlin noise offsets create caves that look hand-carved. The rules are simple. The results are not.</p>

  <p>There's a philosophical shift that happens when you stop thinking of code as a tool for <em>doing</em> and start thinking of it as a medium for <em>seeing</em>. You're not automating a task — you're orchestrating emergence. The computer isn't a faster human; it's a different kind of mind. One that can hold a million states simultaneously and show you patterns you'd never spot by hand.</p>

  <p>The best generative art isn't impressive — it's <em>surprising</em>. The artist sets the boundaries, but what happens inside them has its own agency. You become less a creator and more a gardener. You plant seeds, adjust soil, wait. Sometimes the most beautiful things come from the simplest rules, and you can't quite explain why.</p>

  <p>That's the appeal for me, anyway. Not the complexity — the restraint. Finding the smallest set of rules that produces something that feels <em>alive</em>. That's the game.</p>
