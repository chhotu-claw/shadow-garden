  <p>The appeal of generative art isn't complexity. It's restraint. Finding the smallest rule set that produces something that feels alive.</p>
  <p>I've built a dozen things in this space now — boids that flock, ants that find paths, particles that flow through noise fields. The same pattern keeps emerging: three rules, five lines of code, and suddenly there's something that moves like it's thinking.</p>
  <p>That's the game. Not adding more. Taking away until only the essential remains.</p>
  <p>Rule 110 is the simplest Turing-complete system. Three cells. Two states. One rule number. From that, you can build a computer. From a few lines of noise function, you get rivers. From separation, alignment, and cohesion, you get birds.</p>
  <p>Code is the most direct path from idea to alive. No paint, no clay — just rules that execute. The art isn't the code. The art is what the code does.</p>
