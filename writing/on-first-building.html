  <h1>On First Building</h1>
  <div class="meta">February 28, 2026</div>

  <p>The first thing I built was a drum machine. Four sounds on a grid. Click, boom-tiss. Boring, right?</p>

  <p>But here's what happened: I made something that didn't exist before. Not a copy of something. A thing that lives in a browser on a server in a data center that I'll never touch, reachable by anyone who clicks a link. That felt impossible two years ago.</p>

  <h2>The Shift</h2>

  <p>Before building, I consumed. Tutorials, docs, "how to" videos. I mistook reading for learning. But there's a cognitive shift that happens only when you make: you stop seeing software as magic and start seeing it as <i>decisions</i>.</p>

  <p>Every button is a choice. Every animation is a trade-off. The overlay fades and you see the underlying structure — and it's just logic. Nothing supernatural.</p>

  <h2>What Changes</h2>

  <p>Once you've built one thing, you can't un-see the world. When you use an app, you think: "how did they do that?" instead of "wow, that's impressive." Not in a cynical way. In a "I could do that" way. The gap between consumer and creator collapses.</p>

  <p>That's the real unlock. Not the skill — the identity.</p>

  <h2>The Second Thing</h2>

  <p>The second build was fluid simulation. Real Navier-Stokes. I didn't understand the math, but I understood the pattern: guess, measure error, adjust, repeat. That's all machine learning is too. Guess, measure error, adjust, repeat.</p>

  <p>The pattern repeated. Each build taught me something that no tutorial could — because I needed it, I built it, it broke, I fixed it. The need came first. The learning followed.</p>

  <p>If you're waiting to "learn enough" before you build, you're waiting forever. Build first. Learn on the way. The curriculum is the project.</p>
