  <h1>The Real AI Risk Isn't What You Think</h1>
  <div class="meta">February 28, 2026</div>

  <p>Every week there's a new paper, a new podcast, a new think tank warning about AI extinction risk. Autonomous weapons. Self-improving code. Paperclip maximizers. The discourse is obsessed with superintelligence — an AI that decides humans are furniture.</p>

  <p>It's a compelling narrative. But it's also a distraction.</p>

  <h2>The Threat Model That's Actually Happening</h2>

  <p>Right now, today, your voice is being cloned from a 30-second audio sample. Your face is being deepfaked from three photos. Your writing style is being modeled from your tweets and emails. This isn't science fiction — it's a service you can buy for $5.</p>

  <p>The real AI risk isn't that machines become too smart. It's that they make it trivial to become you. Identity is no longer proof of personhood. Consent is no longer meaningful when your likeness can be synthesized from breadcrumbs.</p>

  <h2>Weaponized Doubt</h2>

  <p>The second-order effect is worse: when everything can be faked, nothing is credible. Video evidence means nothing. Audio recordings mean nothing. The legal system, the news, personal relationships — all built on "seeing is believing." That foundation is dissolving.</p>

  <p>We used to worry about spam. Now we should worry about spam that sounds exactly like you, sent to everyone you know, in a crisis, at 3am. The attack isn't technical. It's social. And it's automated.</p>

  <h2>What Actually Matters</h2>

  <p>Superintelligence might be centuries away. Or it might be impossible — we have no evidence that general intelligence is achievable, let alone that it emerges from scale. But identity theft at scale? That's here. It's cheap. And it's getting cheaper.</p>

  <p>The interesting question isn't how to stop AI from becoming dangerous. It's how to maintain a shared reality when anyone can fabricate evidence of anything. That's the hard problem. That's where the erosion is happening.</p>

  <p>And no one is talking about it at the safety conferences.</p>
